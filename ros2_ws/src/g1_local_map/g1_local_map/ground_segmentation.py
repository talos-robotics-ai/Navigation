Per-cell local-minimum ground segmentation (pure-numpy, no ROS deps).

Robust, voxelization-friendly ground remover for the DLIO **accumulated
odom-frame voxel cloud** the local map builds. Replaces an earlier gravity-aware
SVD/eigen per-cell plane-fit: that method's planarity/flatness ratios are
inflated by the 0.10 m voxel quantization, so most flat-floor cells were rejected
as "not planar" and the floor was kept as obstacles. The local-minimum rule needs
no such ratios and is per-cell relative, so it tolerates the voxel grid, a
tilted/offset floor and sensor-height uncertainty without tuning.

Pipeline:

  1. Tile the cloud into XY cells of size ``cell``. Each cell's local ground
     height is the **minimum** point height (heights measured along gravity-up,
     ``-g_hat``; that is +Z for DLIO odom). Cells with < ``min_pts`` points are
     ignored when setting ground, so a lone stray-low point can't define it.
  2. **Min-pool** the per-cell minima over a 3x3 neighbourhood, so a cell that
     holds only a tall obstacle (and no floor return) is compared against the
     surrounding floor instead of treating the obstacle as its own ground.
  3. Label each point by how far it rises above its cell's local ground:
     ``<= ground_band`` -> ground (drop); ``ground_band .. max_height`` ->
     obstacle (keep); ``> max_height`` -> ceiling (drop).

Fail-safe: an empty/too-sparse cloud passes through (capped at ``max_height``
above the foot); cells whose 3x3 neighbourhood has no valid ground also fail
open. Better a cluttered costmap than a blind one.

Limitation vs a plane-fit method: a LARGE solid elevated slab that fully occludes
the floor beneath it (e.g. a big tabletop the lidar can't see under) has interior
cells with no lower neighbour within the 3x3 window, so its interior reads as
local ground; its edges — and anything standing on it — still register as
obstacles. For navigation this is an acceptable trade for robustness. Within-cell
slope (ramps) is handled only up to ~``ground_band`` of rise across a cell;
widen ``ground_band`` or shrink ``cell`` for steep ramps.
