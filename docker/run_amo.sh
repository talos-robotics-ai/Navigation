# The AMO gait is a velocity tracker; it never sees the goal. Where the velocity
# command (vx, vy, yaw_rate) comes from is the command source (see MODES).
#
# All extra args are forwarded to amo_inference.py, e.g.:
#   ./run_amo.sh                         # uses amo_g1.yaml as-is (source: zero -> stands)
#   ./run_amo.sh --observe_only          # dry run: subscribe to DDS, never publish
#   ./run_amo.sh --vx 0.3                # constant forward velocity (overrides config)
#   ./run_amo.sh --filter critdamp       # enable the running joint filter
#
# MODES (mutually exclusive; pick one, or neither to use the config's source):
#   AUTONOMOUS=1 ./run_amo.sh            # FULL AUTONOMY: track velocity_target from the
#                                        #   A*+MPC planner over WS :8766 (source=websocket).
#                                        #   The planner (a_star_mpc_planner) must be running
#                                        #   in the ROS 2 / localization container — this
#                                        #   script only starts the gait side.
#   JOYSTICK=1   ./run_amo.sh            # MANUAL: drive with the Unitree G1 pad. Used for
#                                        #   teleop / SLAM-mapping a space WITHOUT autonomy.
