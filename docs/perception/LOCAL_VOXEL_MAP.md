# Local Voxel Grid Map (`g1_local_map`)

How the G1's **local rolling 3D voxel map** is computed, from the DLIO point
cloud to the obstacle representation consumed by the **A\*+MPC planner**.

Package: `ros2_ws/src/g1_local_map` · Node: `local_voxel_map_node` ·
Launched by `g1_bringup/real_localization.launch.py` (arg `local_map:=true`).

---

## 1. Why this node exists

DLIO produces two clouds, neither of which is a good *local obstacle* map:

| Topic | What it is | Why not use it for local avoidance |
|---|---|---|
| `/dlio/map_node/map` | Global SLAM map | Only republishes on a new **keyframe** (~1 m / 45° of motion) → far too laggy; grows unbounded; includes the floor. |
| `/dlio/odom_node/pointcloud/deskewed` | Per-scan registered cloud (~10 Hz) | Fast and in `odom`, but **sparse per scan**, **includes the ground**, and unbounded in the past. |

`local_voxel_map_node` turns the fast deskewed cloud into a **bounded,
robot-centred, ground-removed, temporally-densified** obstacle map that refreshes
every scan and forgets what the robot has passed.

---

## 2. Inputs / outputs

**Subscribes** (BEST_EFFORT — see [§6](#6-qos--transport-notes-important)):
- `/dlio/odom_node/pointcloud/deskewed` — `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`, **odom** frame, deskewed + registered, ~10 Hz.
- `/dlio/odom_node/odom` — `nav_msgs/Odometry`, robot pose in odom (used only to centre the rolling window).

**Publishes** (in the `odom` frame):
- `~/obstacles` — `PointCloud2` of ground-removed obstacle **voxel centres**. **This is the planner feed** → point the planner's `obstacle_topic` here.
- `~/voxel_grid` — `PointCloud2`, identical to `~/obstacles`, for RViz / 3D queries.
- `~/costmap` — `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`, a 2D top-down projection (latched, TRANSIENT_LOCAL).

No TF math is needed: the deskewed cloud is already in `odom`, and the window is
centred on the odom-frame robot position from the odometry message.

---

## 3. The pipeline (per scan)

```
deskewed cloud (odom) ─┐
                       ├─► 1. crop  ─► 2. accumulate (raw, +decay) ─► 3. ground removal ─► 4. publish
odom (robot xyz) ──────┘
```

### 1. Rolling-window crop
Keep only points that are:
- within an **XY box** `±half_width` (default **8 m**) of the robot,
- within a **vertical band** `[robot_z − z_below, robot_z + z_above]` (defaults **1.5 m / 1.5 m**),
- **outside** `min_range` (default **0.4 m**) of the robot — drops self-hits / the body.

> **Why `z_below` must reach below the floor.** DLIO's `baselink2lidar` translation
> is zero, so the odom origin sits at the **sensor**, ~1 m above the ground →
> the floor lands near `z ≈ −1 m` in odom. If `z_below` doesn't reach it, the
> floor is cropped out *before* ground segmentation, which then has no ground
> reference and lets low obstacles/floor leak through. Hence `z_below = 1.5 m`.

### 2. Accumulate raw points into a decaying voxel grid
The cropped **raw** points (floor included) are inserted into a voxel occupancy
grid in the odom frame (`VoxelAccumulator`):
- Each point maps to an integer voxel index `floor(p / voxel_size)` (default **0.10 m**).
- Each occupied voxel stores the **last time it was seen**.
- Every scan, voxels are **pruned** if older than `persistence_s` (default **3 s**)
  or outside the rolling window — bounding memory and forgetting the past.

Keying voxels by absolute odom indices means the grid **never needs
re-centring**; the robot-centred window is enforced purely by the prune step.

> **Vectorised for the Jetson (2026-07-04).** `VoxelAccumulator` stores voxels as
> two parallel numpy arrays — bit-packed `int64` keys + last-seen times — so
> update/prune/`centers()` are single vectorised passes. This replaced a
> dict-of-tuples with a Python loop per voxel per scan (~30–60 k iterations at
> 10 Hz), the node's top CPU cost on the Orin Nano: **29.8 → 2.4 ms per scan,
> output bit-identical.** The published cloud is now built directly from the
> float32 buffer (`make_cloud_xyz32`) and the RViz-only `voxel_grid` topic is
> skipped when nobody subscribes. See
> [../planning/DISTRIBUTED_NAV_PLAN.md](../planning/DISTRIBUTED_NAV_PLAN.md) §9.

> **Why accumulate _before_ removing ground.** A single MID-360 scan is sparse —
> roughly one point per `ground_cell`. Per-cell ground segmentation on one scan
> would treat that lone point as its own ground and drop nearly everything.
> Accumulating ~`persistence_s × 10` scans first gives each cell enough points
> for the floor to be a reliable per-cell minimum. **This ordering is the fix for
> the "empty map" bug — never segment a single scan.**

### 3. Ground removal — per-cell local-minimum filter
Run on the **accumulated (dense)** voxel centres by
`ground_segmentation.segment_ground` (a pure-numpy, ROS-free module; full design
in [`docs/perception/GROUND_SEGMENTATION.md`](GROUND_SEGMENTATION.md)). Heights are measured
along gravity-up (`−g_hat`, ≈ `+Z` for DLIO odom).

1. **Tile** the cloud into XY cells of size `ground_cell` (default **0.40 m**).
2. **Per-cell local ground = the minimum height** in the cell; cells with
   `< ground_min_pts` points are ignored (a lone stray-low point can't define it).
3. **3×3 min-pool** the per-cell minima, so a cell that holds *only* a tall
   obstacle is compared against the surrounding floor (not treated as its own
   ground).
4. **Label** each point by its rise above the cell's pooled ground:
   `≤ ground_band` → ground (drop); `ground_band … max_height` → obstacle (keep);
   `> max_height` → ceiling (drop).

Per-cell-**relative**, so it tolerates a tilted/offset floor, sensor-height
uncertainty and the 0.10 m voxel quantization **without tuning**. This replaced a
gravity-aware SVD plane-fit (see [`GROUND_REMOVAL_PLAN.md`](GROUND_REMOVAL_PLAN.md))
whose planarity/flatness *ratios* were inflated by voxelization, causing most
flat-floor cells to be kept as obstacles. Trade-off: a large slab that fully
occludes the floor under it has its interior read as ground (edges + anything on
it still block) — details and tuning in
[`GROUND_SEGMENTATION.md`](GROUND_SEGMENTATION.md) §4.

**Fail-safe by construction:** an empty / `< ground_min_total` cloud passes
through (capped at `max_height` above the foot), and cells whose 3×3 neighbourhood
has no valid ground fail open (keep geometry). Better a cluttered costmap than a
blind one.

### 4. Publish
The surviving obstacle voxel centres are published as `~/obstacles` and
`~/voxel_grid`; the 2D column projection is published as `~/costmap`. The node
publishes **every scan, even when empty**, so the costmap never goes stale.

---

## 4. The 2D costmap projection

`~/costmap` is an `OccupancyGrid` of `2*half_width / voxel_size` cells per side
(default 160×160 at 0.10 m), centred on the robot:
- any XY cell containing ≥1 obstacle voxel → **100** (occupied),
- all other cells → `costmap_unknown_as` (default **−1 = unknown**; set **0** for free).

It is a convenience/visualization layer; the planner's primary input is the
`~/obstacles` cloud.

---

## 5. Feeding the A\*+MPC planner

The planner's default **`gaussian`** backend subscribes to a raw obstacle
`PointCloud2` on its `obstacle_topic` (BEST_EFFORT, odom frame) and builds its own
Gaussian-inflated cost grid + 2.5D height map internally. So:

- Set the planner's **`obstacle_topic` → `/local_voxel_map/obstacles`**.
- Frame is `odom` (matches the planner's pose frame).
- The planner does its *own* ground segmentation too; pre-removing ground here is
  complementary and keeps the fed cloud small.
- If you want the fed cloud at the planner's grid resolution, set
  `voxel_size:=0.05` (default here is 0.10 m).

---

## 6. QoS / transport notes (important)

These were learned the hard way on this stack (see
[`project_dds_distro_pollution`] notes / `DLIO_DEPLOYMENT_TESTING.md`):

- **Subscriptions are BEST_EFFORT.** DLIO publishes the large deskewed cloud
  `RELIABLE` + `KeepLast(1)`. A *reliable* reader loses the fragment-reassembly
  race against that depth-1 writer and **freezes on the first frame**; a
  best-effort reader takes each burst instead.
- **The bring-up pins `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42`** to isolate the Humble stack from the
  ROS 2 **Jazzy host**; a cross-distro participant on the same domain corrupts
  CycloneDDS deserialization of the big PointCloud2 (`serdata.cpp:384`). Do
  **not** also set `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1` — with CycloneDDS that disables
  multicast and caps the domain at ~10 participant indices, so this 9-node stack
  dies with "Failed to find a free participant index". The best-effort readers
  (above) already handle the large cloud without it.
- **Outputs are RELIABLE + KeepLast(5)** so they serve both a reliable subscriber
  (RViz) and a best-effort one (the planner); depth > 1 avoids the same race.
- **Debug from inside the container on `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42`** — and verify clouds
  via **RViz**, not `ros2 topic hz` (a fresh CLI participant can't pull the large
  cloud even when the co-spawned RViz can).

## 8. Run / verify

```bash
# full stack (DLIO + local map), in the localization container:
ros2 launch g1_bringup real_localization.launch.py        # local_map:=true by default

# standalone, against an already-running DLIO:
ros2 launch g1_local_map local_map.launch.py voxel_size:=0.05

# verify in RViz (LocalVoxelMap display) — NOT via ros2 topic hz from the host.
```
Expect: the floor removed, walls/obstacles within ±8 m shown as orange boxes,
refreshing as the robot moves; `~/costmap` populated.
