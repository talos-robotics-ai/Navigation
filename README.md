# Navigation

Deployment layer for the Unitree G1 navigation stack. This folder packages the
robot software into three decoupled Docker images and holds the RoboJuDo AMO
gait policy used for real-robot walking.

## The three images

| Image | Base | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **unitree** | `ros:humble-desktop` | ROS 2 ↔ robot bridge: Unitree SDK2, message packages, teleop, joystick, RViz. |
| **localization** | `ros:humble-desktop` | FAST-LIO LiDAR-inertial localization for the MID-360 (Open3D 0.14.1, Livox SDK 1/2, PCL). |
| **amo_policy** | `python:3.11-slim-bookworm` | The RoboJuDo **AMO RL gait** that drives the joints, over CycloneDDS via `unitree_sdk2py`. **No ROS 2.** |

They are independent and communicate at run time over CycloneDDS and ROS 2 /
WebSocket — never by sharing a Python environment. See
[docs/system_architecture.md](docs/system_architecture.md) for the end-to-end
data flow and [docs/dockerfiles.md](docs/dockerfiles.md) for the image
framework, shared DDS conventions (`UNITREE_NET_IFACE`, host networking), and
why the stack is split three ways.

## RoboJuDo

[RoboJuDo](https://github.com/HansZ8/RoboJuDo) is a plug-and-play robot
deployment framework (controller / environment / policy, modular and
composable). The AMO gait runs through its `UnitreeEnv` + `AMOPolicy`. It needs
Python ≥ 3.11, `torch`, `mujoco` (mandatory — forward kinematics), and the
Unitree DDS bindings; the `amo_policy` image provides all of these.

`policy/RoboJuDo` is a **symlink** to the RoboJuDo checkout. Ensure the resolved
directory is mounted into the container at run time (the compose file does this).

## Quick start — AMO policy

Use [docker/run_amo.sh](docker/run_amo.sh) — it builds `CYCLONEDDS_URI` from the
NIC, mounts the `amo/` code + RoboJuDo + config, and forwards all args to
`amo_inference.py`:

```bash
cd Navigation/docker

BUILD=1 NET_IF=eth0 ./run_amo.sh --observe_only   # build, then dry run (no motor cmds)
NET_IF=eth0 ./run_amo.sh                           # run with amo_g1.yaml as-is (stands)
NET_IF=eth0 ./run_amo.sh --vx 0.3                  # walk forward at a constant velocity
```

Equivalent raw compose call:

```bash
UNITREE_NET_IFACE=eth0 docker compose run --rm --service-ports amo_policy \
    python /workspace/amo/amo_inference.py --config /workspace/config/amo_g1.yaml --observe_only
```

`docker compose up amo_policy` drops to a `bash` shell by default — no motors
move on `up`.

### AMO inference + joint smoothing

`amo/amo_inference.py` runs the RoboJuDo AMO gait through a **smoothing stack**
so the joints never snap to the policy reference at activation:

- **Startup (always):** an S-curve blend from the robot's captured posture to the
  first AMO reference, while PD gains ramp soft → full.
- **Per-tick (always):** a clamp capping each joint at `clamp_delta_rad`/tick — a
  hard anti-snap safety rail.
- **Running filter (optional):** an always-on slew/low-pass filter (`ewma` /
  `critdamp`). **Default is `none`** (`filter.kind` in
  [config/amo_g1.yaml](docker/config/amo_g1.yaml)) so the trained gait runs at
  full bandwidth — startup smoothing + clamp still apply.

Tunables are in [docker/config/amo_g1.yaml](docker/config/amo_g1.yaml); CLI flags
override them: `--observe_only`, `--net_if`, `--filter {none,ewma,critdamp}`,
`--vx/--vy/--yaw`. Design notes: [docs/amo_inference_plan.md](docs/amo_inference_plan.md).
Run the filter unit tests:

```bash
cd Navigation/amo && python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```

### Velocity command input

The AMO policy is a **velocity tracker** — it consumes `(vx, vy, yaw_rate)`, not
goals/waypoints (goal→velocity planning lives upstream in the MPC). The source is
`command.source` in the config:

| `source` | Command comes from | When |
|---|---|---|
| `zero` | always `(0,0,0)` — stand in place | default / safe |
| `constant` | `command.constant` in YAML, or `--vx/--vy/--yaw` | static manual / bench |
| `websocket` | live JSON `{"vx","vy","yaw"}` on `:8766` | **MPC planner**, or manual sends |

With `source: websocket` the server accepts any client, so you can drive it
manually:

```bash
echo '{"vx":0.3,"vy":0.0,"yaw":0.1}' | websocat ws://localhost:8766
```

The last value sent is held until the next message. See
[docs/system_architecture.md](docs/system_architecture.md) for how the MPC feeds
this in the full navigation loop.

## Building / running the ROS 2 images

```bash
cd Navigation/docker
UNITREE_NET_IFACE=eth0 docker compose up unitree        # robot bridge + teleop
UNITREE_NET_IFACE=eth0 docker compose up localization   # FAST-LIO localization
```

Both use host networking + IPC so DDS discovery reaches the robot.

The **FAST-LIO workspace is local and editable** at [ros2_ws/](ros2_ws/),
bind-mounted to `/ws`. Open3D and the Livox SDKs are baked into the image, but
the workspace itself is built **inside the container** the first time:

```bash
cd Navigation/docker
docker compose run --rm localization bash
build_ws        # rosdep + colcon; build/ install/ log/ persist on the host (git-ignored)
```
